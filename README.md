# Lovesac Crosswalk Demo

This repo is an Helix/Franklin/NGC/SuccessEdge/EDN project that will serve as the basis for showcasing Project Crosswalk's ability to leverage a Helix project (this codebase) within Universal Editor and to serve the composed experience over the Helix "Edge Delivery Network".  

## Environments

## Configurator and CORS
Currently there is a CORs issue preventing [the configurator](https://configurator-v2--lovesac--tuckerelliott.hlx.live/sactionals/build/203a585400317f3b2b900f32ffa8886b) from showing in a normal context. You can disable CORs Restrictions in Safari in `Develop` >> `Disable CORs Restrictions`.

## Devcontainers

This repository has a `.devcontainer` directory suitable for running the project in vscode or Github Codespaces. By default, the devcontainer will install node dependancies and run `hlx up` resulting in a development server spawning on port `3000`.

## Page Templates

`templates/blank.html` contains a representation of a lovesac page. There is a `<content>` div around line 310 that can be used to anchor content.
